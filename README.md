# sublime-channel

Channel for various Sublime Text packages. This is mainly for my own development and includes things I do not intend to
put on Package Control, or things I'd like to make available for convenience before while in development.

## Usage

Add JSON to the list in `Package Control.sublime-settings`.

```js
{
    "repositories":
    [
        "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/facelessuser/sublime-channel/master/repositories.json",
    ],
}
````
